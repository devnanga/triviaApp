CHORUS: Devil woman, devil woman, let go of me Devil woman, let me be Just leave me alone, I want to go home. Mary is waiting and weeping alone in our shack by the sea Even after I hurt her, Mary' still in love with me Devil woman, it's over, trapped no more by your charms I don't want to stay, I want to get away, Women let go of my arms. (CHORUS) Devil woman, you're evil like the dark coral reef Like the winds that bring high tides, you bring sorrow and grief You made me so ashamed to face Mary, barely had the strength to tell Skies are not so black, Mary took me back, Mary has broken your spell.

Roll - out - those Lazy-hazy-crazy days of summer, Those days of soda and pretzels and beer. Roll - out - those Lazy-hazy-crazy days of summer, You'll wish that summer could always be here. Don't have to tell a girl and fella 'bout a drive-in, Or some romantic movie scene. Why, from the moment that those lovers start arriving, You'll see more kissing in the cars than on the screen.

A woman that he can call his very own. A woman who'll stay right there at home and mind the children while he's gone to work. A woman who'll have his dinner cooked when he comes home. Where some men make mistakes is when they go out and stay because they feel that no other man wants his woman but him. But listen: Sings: If you think no other man wants her Just throw her away and you will see Some man will have her Before you can count 1, 2, 3 Yes, they will, yes, he will Spoken: Ha Ha! Listen girls This goes for you, too. Because you know I've seen so many women Who've had so many good men in life. Men who would stand by 'em through thick and thin. Men who would go to work everyday and bring home their hard earned pay. Men who would give their women anything that their little heart desired. Where some women make mistakes is when their men go out and let 'em play. They would stay because they felt that no other woman wanted him but her. Listen: Sings: If you think that no other woman wants him just pitch him out in the streets and you will see. Some woman will have your man Before you can count 1, 2, 3. Yes, you will, yes you will."

I've passed this way before. I've felt this pain before. A hurt that took so long to end. Has found my poor heart again. No matter how strong a man is. Without a love he walks in the dark, baby. If love deserts him it would surely hurt him. 'Cause his weakness is his heart. A lonely journey now stands before me. The endless pain has started. But this time I know the way. Walking alone and broken hearted. Because I've passed this way before. And I've felt this pain before. A hurt that took so long to end. Has found my poor heart again. I've passed this way before.

Sitting in the classroom Thinking it's a drag Listening to the teacher rap Just ain't my bag The noon bells ring You know that's my cue I'm gonna meet the boys On floor number two! Smokin' in the boys' room Smokin' in the boys' room Now, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules But everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school. A-checkin' out the halls Makin' sure the coast is clear Lookin' in the stalls No, there ain't nobody here Oh, my buddy Fang, and me and Paul To get caught would surely be the death of us all Smokin' in the boys' room Smokin' in the boys' room Now, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules But everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school. All right! Oh, put me to work In the school book store Check out counter And I got bored Teacher was lookin' For me all around Two hours later You know where I was found Smokin' in the boys' room (Yes indeed, I was) Smokin' in the boys' room Now, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules But everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school. One mo'! Smokin' in the boys' room Oh, smokin' in the boys' room Now, teacher, I am fully aware of the rules But everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school!"

    "lyrics_snippet": "The United States dollar took another pounding on German, French, and British exchanges this morning, hitting the lowest point ever known in West Germany. It has declined there by 41 since 1971, and this Canadian thinks it's time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people in all the world. As long as sixty years ago, when I first started to read newspapers, I read of floods on the Yellow River and the Yangtze. Well, who rushed in with men and money to help? The Americans did, that's who. They have helped control floods on the Nile, the Amazon, the Ganges, and the Niger. Today, the rich bottom land of the Mississippi is underwater, and no foreign land has sent a dollar to help. Germany, Japan, and to a lesser extent Britain and Italy, were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts. None of those countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States. When the franc was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris--and I was there, I saw that. When distant cities are hit by earthquake, it's the United States that hurries in to help; Managua, Nicaragua is one of the most recent examples. So far this spring, 59 American communities have been flattened by tornadoes--nobody has helped. The Marshall Plan, the Truman Policy--all pumped billions upon billions of dollars into discouraged countries, and now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent, war-mongering Americans. Now, I'd like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build it's own airplanes. Come on, now you--lets hear it! Does any country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing jumbo jet, the Lockheed Tristar, or the Douglas Ten. If so, why dont they fly them? Why do all international lines except Russia fly American planes? Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or a woman on the moon? You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios. You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles. You talk about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon, not once, but several times, and safely home again. You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at. Even the draft dodgers are not pursued and hounded. Theyre right here on our streets in Toronto. Most of them, unless theyre breaking Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend up here. When the Americans get out of this bind, as they will, who could blame them if they said to hell with the rest of the world. Let somebody else buy the bonds. Let somebody else build or repair foreign dams, or design foreign buildings that wont shake apart in earthquakes. When the railways of France and Germany and India were breaking down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both of them are still broke. I can name to you five thousand times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name to me even one time when someone raced to the help of the Americans in trouble? I dont think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake. Our neighbors have faced it alone. And Im one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them kicked around. Theyll come out of this thing with their flag high, and when they do, theyre entitled to thumb their noses at the lands that are gloating over their present trouble. I hope Canada is not one of these. But there are many smug, self-righteous Canadians. And finally, the American Red Cross was told at it's 48th annual meeting in New Orleans this morning that it was broke. This years disasters, with the year less than half over, have taken it all, and nobody, but nobody, has helped. --"

He was a skater boy She said see you later boy He wasn't good enough for her Now he's a super star Slamming on his guitar Does your pretty face see what he's worth? Sorry girl but you missed out Well tough luck that boy's mine now We are more than just good friends This is how the story ends Too bad that you couldn't see, See the man that boy could be There is more than meets the eye I see the soul that is inside He's just a boy And Im just a girl Can I make it any more obvious We are in love Haven't you heard How we rock each others world I'm with the skater boy I said see you later boy I'll be back stage after the show I'll be at the studio Singing the song we wrote About a girl you used to know I'm with the skater boy I said see you later boy I'll be back stage after the show I'll be at the studio Singing the song we wrote About a girl you used to know"
